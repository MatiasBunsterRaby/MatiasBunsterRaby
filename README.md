## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm MatÃ­as, currently pursuing a Magister in Data Science. Specialized in advanced data analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP. Passionate about how technology can help businesses succeed.

I'm interested in joining a team that shares the same passion.

In my free time, I like to read, travel, hike, and enjoy a cup of coffee.

If you are interested in working together, feel free to drop me a line at matias.bunster@grancapital.cl.
